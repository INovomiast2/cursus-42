Welcome to 42Cursus by: INovomiast2
===================================

**42Cursus** it's my entire 42Curriculum, the projects I've been forging for arround
a long time as a Student of **42** MÃ¡laga. So feel free to see the documentation of
every project, there, I give explanation to all my code and even show you little
tips and tricks.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

.. note::

   Any action taken by the Student (**you**)
   with the code I put here it's under yourself.
   This is a sideproject to documentate all my
   42 experience and show little tricks.
