So Long: And thanks for all the fish!
=====================================

This is the project **so_long**, the objective it's to create a simple 2D game
and learn to use your first gui-lib, so basically you'll learn how to do a game
from 0 with C and MiniLibX (mlx42 is valid too (at least in my campus)).
